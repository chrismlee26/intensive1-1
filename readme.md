Hello

This is a landing page for "Limited Run", my INT1.1 Project. 
The project will be built in a few stages: 

MVP will be HTML/CSS with links going to wireframes and stock
images.

As the project progresses the wireframes will be changed into
actual pages in HTMl/CSS.

If possible some JS will be added for pop-up forms and an
overall more responsive design.

Parallax through CSS will the final stage to make the page 
more fun.
