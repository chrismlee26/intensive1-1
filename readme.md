This is a landing page for "Limited Run", my INT1.1 Project
based on my project for SPD1.1

The project will be built in 5 stages: 

1. MVP will be HTML/CSS with links going to wireframes and stock
images.

2. As the project progresses the wireframes will be changed into
actual pages in HTMl/CSS with better images and a little more 
styling, color and content.

3. If possible some JS will be added for pop-up forms and an
overall more responsive design were improvements could be made.

<--- This is as far as I got --->

4. Mobile wireframes will be added.

5. Parallax through CSS will the final stage to make the page 
more fun. Maybe some diagrams but unlikely.

The idea behind the project was to create a infographic styled 
series of landing pages which could be eventually turned into more 
and more code as my skills progress in the future.

Most of what I was unable to code over the week I made as static
wireframes in Adobe XD.

The code is mostly simple HTML+CSS with a bit of Javascript in the
form of a clicker button and a profit calculator and a modal pop-up
which somehow died during import. I will attempt to add a rotating 
gallery, modals for static images but this is dependant on time for 
the week.
