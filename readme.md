Hello,

This is a landing page for "Limited Run", my INT1.1 Project
based on my project for SPD1.1.

The project will be built in 5 stages: 

1. MVP will be HTML/CSS with links going to wireframes and stock
images.

2. As the project progresses the wireframes will be changed into
actual pages in HTMl/CSS with better images and a little more 
styling and colors.

3. If possible some JS will be added for pop-up forms and an
overall more responsive design.

4. Mobile wireframes will be added.

5. Parallax through CSS will the final stage to make the page 
more fun. Maybe some diagrams but unlikely.
